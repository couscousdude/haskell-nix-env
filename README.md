# Nix Haskell Development Environment

This repository contains some basic `nix` configuration files that allow you to generate a fully self-contained Haskell development environment and access the `ghc` and `cabal` executables.

## Usage

Run `nix-shell`. You'll then have access to `ghc`, `ghci`, and `cabal`.
